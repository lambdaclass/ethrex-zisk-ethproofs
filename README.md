## Install

To install Zisk-ethproofs, use the following command:
```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Run

To run Zisk-Ethproofs and start submitting block proofs to Ethproofs, use the following command:

```bash
zisk-ethproofs
```

### Command-line flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-n, --no-ethproofs` | Disable proof status reporting and submission to Ethproofs. Only block proving will be performed |
| `-p, --no-proof`| Disable block proof generation. Only generate input file |
| `-b, --block-submit-alert` | Send a Telegram alert when a block proof is successfully submitted to Ethproofs. By default, only error/warning alerts are sent |
| `-t, --test-block <TEST_BLOCK>` | Generate and submit the proof for a specific block only. Useful for testing or troubleshooting. Example: `-t 22137695` |
| `-d, --disable-distributed` | Disable distributed proving. The proof will be generated using a single process |
| `-k, --keep-input` | Keeps the block input file after proof generation (does not delete it) |
| `-o, --keep-output`| Keeps the output folder where proof files are stored (does not delete it) |

### Folders

The following folders will be created during the execution of Zisk-Ethproofs:

| Folder       | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./input`    | Stores the input file generated for each block                                              |
| `./proof`    | Stores the proof files generated for each block. A subfolder named after the block number will be created for each block |
| `./log`      | Stores the log file generated for each block                                                |
